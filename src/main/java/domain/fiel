This is the core layer of your application, containing only the most fundamental classes and logic. This layer should be entirely independent of any specific implementation details or frameworks.
What to include:

Entities: Basic classes representing real-world objects in your application, such as UserAccount, Stock, Portfolio, and Transaction.
Value Objects: Simple objects like dates, prices, and amounts that hold values used by multiple entities.
Basic Business Logic: Simple methods that are directly related to the entity, like calculating the total value of a portfolio.
