Purpose:

This layer handles external dependencies like APIs, databases, or any third-party service. This makes it easy to replace external services without impacting core application logic.
What to include:

API Integrations: Classes that handle API requests and responses (e.g., getting stock prices).
Database Connections: Classes for saving and retrieving data if you implement persistent storage.
Utility Classes: Helper classes for specific tasks, like formatting dates or parsing JSON.
