Purpose:

This layer acts as a bridge between the use cases and the UI layer. It adapts data to be displayed in the UI and handles inputs from the UI to the use cases.
What to include:

Controllers: Receive input from the UI (e.g., user actions like “buy” or “sell”) and trigger the appropriate use case.
Presenters: Format the output of use cases to prepare it for display in the UI.
