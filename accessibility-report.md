# Accessibility Report for StockFlow

## Principles of Universal Design

### 1. Equitable Use
StockFlow adheres to equitable use by providing a risk-free trading experience for all users, regardless of their trading background. The app is designed with beginners in mind, ensuring that anyone, from a student to a novice investor, can access and learn about stock trading. Its intuitive interface with easy-to-understand features, like the AI Chatbot, helps bridge the gap for users with minimal financial knowledge.

### 2. Flexibility in Use
StockFlow accommodates users with diverse preferences by providing multiple ways to interact with the system. For example, the Explore Page offers various ways to search for stocks—by ticker, exchange, or keyword—catering to both experienced traders and those new to the stock market. The customizable charts and technical indicators also offer flexibility for users who prefer visual or data-driven analysis.

### 3. Simple and Intuitive Use
The user interface of StockFlow is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it accessible for users with varying levels of experience. The layout of the Home Page, Explore Page, and Portfolio Page is easy to navigate. Additionally, the AI Chatbot provides an easy way for users to ask questions and get personalized guidance on stock-related topics.

### 4. Perceptible Information
StockFlow ensures that essential information is presented clearly. Key stock data such as price, indicators (EMA, SMA, RSI), and company summaries are easy to read, and real-time updates are displayed clearly. The app’s colour scheme and font size are chosen to ensure readability for users with varying visual needs, although further improvements, such as the inclusion of a dark mode, could enhance accessibility.

### 5. Tolerance for Error
StockFlow minimizes the risk of user error by providing clear instructions and feedback for actions. For example, when buying or selling stocks, the app shows confirmation messages to ensure users are aware of their transactions. In future versions, adding undo features and more error handling, especially in case of failed transactions, could further reduce the potential for mistakes.

### 6. Low Physical Effort
The app’s design reduces the physical effort required to interact with it. Navigation is simplified with clear buttons and controls, and the use of Java Swing’s interactive components ensures a smooth experience with minimal clicks or complex gestures. The ability to search for stocks via ticker, exchange, or keyword further reduces the need for users to manually sift through irrelevant information.

### 7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
StockFlow is designed with a layout that ensures sufficient space between elements. Buttons and touch targets are appropriately sized for easy interaction, ensuring that users can easily click or tap on their desired actions, whether they are on a desktop or using a mobile device.

## Target Market for StockFlow
StockFlow is primarily aimed at beginner traders, finance enthusiasts, and students seeking to learn about stock trading in a risk-free environment. It serves those interested in practicing stock market strategies without the financial risk involved. Specifically, StockFlow is an excellent tool for university students studying finance, business, or economics who want a practical, hands-on experience with simulated trading. Additionally, the app could appeal to anyone curious about the stock market, from casual investors to individuals exploring new career paths in finance.

## Demographic Considerations
StockFlow could be less accessible to certain demographics, especially those with limited access to technology or users who are not familiar with financial concepts. While the app is designed to be educational and user-friendly, it assumes a certain level of technological literacy, which may exclude older adults or individuals who have not used stock trading platforms. Additionally, the app could be less appealing to users who prefer traditional trading platforms with real-world financial stakes. However, by continuing to enhance features like voice recognition for accessibility and multilingual support, StockFlow could cater to a more diverse range of users, including those with disabilities or non-English speakers.
